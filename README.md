# Introduction
This is my first ASP.NET Core web application build with Razor Pages. The purpose of it is to allow me to practice working with an API. A friend of mine insisted that I use a Chuck Norris API, so I did.

# Core Functionality
- User can search for jokes containing keywords.
- User can request a new random joke.
